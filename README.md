## I'm a creative data analyst, with a great interest in answering questions by leverging as much data as possible. 

I've built web applications using Python and Javascript, setup and hosted SQL databases, and several kinds of dashboards and visualizations. I'm always looking to improve my skillset by leverging new technologies.
