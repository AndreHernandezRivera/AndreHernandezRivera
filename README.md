## About me

My projects show I have the skills to build and deploy end-to-end solutions for a variety of domains, incorporating data engineering, machine learning, data science and analytics concepts.

I've built web applications using Python and Javascript, setup and hosted SQL databases, and built several kinds of dashboards and visualizations. I'm always looking to improve my skillset by leverging new technologies.
